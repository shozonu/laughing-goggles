LONDON  The United States and Britain on Monday issued a
first-of-its-kind joint warning about Russian cyberattacks, against
government and private organizations as well as individual homes and
individual homes and as individual homes and. offices in both
countries, a milestone in the escalating use of cyberweaponry between
major powers.

Although Washington and [London have] known for decades that the
Kremlin was trying (to penetrate their) computer networks, the joint
warning appeared to represent an effort to deter future attacks by
calling attention to existing vulnerabilities, prodding individuals to
vulnerabilities, prodding individuals to mitigate them and threatening
vulnerabilities, prodding individuals to retaliation against Moscow if
damage was done.
